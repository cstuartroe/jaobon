# Jaobon!

is a constructed language with only 366 morphemes, all monosyllabic. Notably, these 366 syllables are the entire set of syllables distinguishable by Jaobon phonology; thus, every phonologically possible syllable has a meaning assigned to it. Almost all of these morphemes are derived from Mandarin, Spanish, and English, although there are a handful derived in whole or part from other languages: Japanese, Hindi, Latin, Arabic, etc.

Like Mandarin, Jaobon has no morphology which modifies phonemes or results in syllable rebracketing. In this sense, Jaobon can be said to be a purely analytical language. 

The syntax of Jaobon is mostly head-initial, with SVO default word order, prepositions, and relative clauses which occur after the noun. However, compound nouns are head-final, and adjectives and other noun modifiers may appear before the noun when restrictive. Demonstratives and cardinal numbers appear before the noun. This syntax is broadly similar to the main source languages - Mandarin, Spanish, and English. Jaobon also uses [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_noun) nouns extensively in a manner similar to Mandarin, appearing after a noun. 

Jaobon is in large part inspired by, and in response to, Toki Pona; it shares many similarities but also a few key philosophical differences: more roots, shorter roots, and an explicitly prescribed dictionary of root collocations to express more complex concepts. Also, in contrast to Toki Pona's fairly neutral/unique flavor, I think that Jaobon has a distinct affinity with the [Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia_linguistic_area) (particularly with Chinese languages) in its phonotactics, syntax, semantics, and overall feel. 

Jaobon has three canonical writing systems:

- The Latin alphabet, which is preferable for input methods and informal communication.
- CJK characters, with a set of 366 in use in a one-to-one relationship with Jaobon morphemes. I use simplified Chinese characters to write Jaobon, with the justification that visual simplicity should be prioritized for such a small grapheme set. I prefer the use of CJK characters when reading; all texts on this site are rendered in CJK characters by default. 
- A general-purpose featural script called Featural Dots, which is space-efficient and cool!

If you look at the root list, you may soon realize that *jao bon* means "foot-bottom" (*bon* being a relational noun), or, logically, the sole of the foot. Why would I name the language something so random? In the [first iteration of Jaobon](/history), *jao bon* was a direct calque of the name of Toki Pona, coming from Mandarin 叫 and Spanish *bueno*. In the next version, the meanings of most syllables were reassigned, and *jao bon* happened to now mean "foot-bottom"; I was charmed by the new semantics and decided not to rename the language. Jaobon is now on its third iteration, but the meanings of both *jao* and *bon* happen not to have changed since version 2, and I like the nonsense name as much as I ever did. 

# History

## Jaobon 1 (2014)

The Jaobon project was begun in September or October 2014 - the first written reference to it I have is a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2i4l0k/introducing_jaobon_a_major_departure_from_my/) from 2 Oct 2014. The phonology was extremely similar, with the same consonant and vowel inventories, and lacking only coda /k/ and /s/ and the diphthong /oi̯/ relative to the current version. This gave it a total of 192 possible roots (17 consonants times 12 finals, minus 12 impossible combinations because /ti/, /di/, /si/, /hi/, /ji/, and /wu/ were avoided, just as in the current version of Jaobon). However, there were some gaps - I started with 184 roots, at some point going up to 188. A 184-root list is available in a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2ihs4y/jaobon_hanzi/) which also includes the CJK characters I associated with each root. A 188-root list is available in the [Memrise course](https://community-courses.memrise.com/community/course/409937/basic-jaobon/) I created some time later.

Because the phonology and number of roots were so different, the rate of lexical similarity between 2014 Jaobon and now is quite low, and few roots are recognizably preserved since then. A glance at my [2014 translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2i4z7k/sample_of_jaobon/) of The North Wind and the Sun shows this off well: the roots which are more or less the same as their current versions include *bin*, *i*, *ke*, and *lai*, but overall the text is very different from an [up-to-date translation](/texts/classics/north_wind).

There are many other differences in addition to lexical. Firstly, the grammar was fairly different from both current Jaobon and the source languages: what are now voice particles functioned then more like case markers, making the word order actually somewhat flexible between SVO, SOV, and OSV, and noun phrases were strictly left-branching. Also, roots were only sourced from English, Spanish, and Mandarin, though a few grammatical particles were invented a priori. Lastly, there were some orthographic differences: /t͡ʃ ʃ/ were ⟨ch sh⟩ rather than ⟨c x⟩, and I wrote compound words without spaces.

## Subsequent projects (2015)

In those early materials, I called Jaobon "oligosynthetic", a term which has varying definitions but was [in vogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2vr4fc/the_rconlangs_oligosynthesis_debate/) on /r/conlangs at the time to describe languages with as few as 20ish morphemes, the most well-known of which was [Vahn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vahn/), which boasts 37 morphemes. (The term "oligoanalytic" also exists which probably better describes Jaobon and Toki Pona, though I may not have known it at the time; under such usage, Vahn is still a good example of an oligosynthetic language as its morphemes are only one or two phonemes, and phonological words may be multimorphemic.) I think it's true that Jaobon was at that time as much or more a response to the oligosynthesis wave as to Toki Pona in particular, and my intention was to create a language with a somewhat restrictive morpheme inventory that still felt fairly natural, unlike the (in my then-perception) mind-bending and semantically restricted and vague oligolangs.

In February 2015, [I declared](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2wdlcz/introducing_kus_jaaw_a_catechoradical_language/) that 184 roots had been too few and that I was done with oligosynthesis, starting a new project that I dubbed "catechoradical" - a step above oligosynthetic languages in morpheme count with 512, though still capped very low relative to natural languages. I have no other memories or written records of that catechoradical project and I don't think I developed it further, but it's clear that after a few months of dabbling I was feeling quite cramped with the sub-200 inventory of roots.

In fall 2015, I started work on [Lauvìnko](https://lauvinko.conorstuartroe.com/), a naturalistic language set in early modern Malaysia, and in connection I created a sibling project [Basabano](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3nhx7o/basabano_my_catechoradical_creole/), a language sharing many traits with Jaobon but which was framed as a creole between Malay, English, Portuguese (≈ Spanish), Hokkien (≈ Mandarin), Hindi, and Arabic, a plausible occurrence in that time and place but also - shock and awe - a language with few lexemes, all of which derive from the most widely spoken languages in the world and is easy to learn. I created about [250 roots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-Kuwv3nf6l3lt45ftNZQLh-IzqbOM5-fMGuVmSqnRE/edit?usp=sharing), though the bisyllabic phonology permitted thousands and I expressed an intention to create at least several hundred. I also evidently gained enough facility in the language to [journal in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/3odam9/a_journal_entry_in_basabano_it_may_not_look_like/), but work stalled on the project at some point. I think I must have concluded it was infeasible to combine the naturalistic origin story and the very much engineered nature of an oligoanalytic language. 

Nonetheless, Basabano seems to have planted a couple of ideas in my mind that would be remembered when I came back around to Jaobon. For one, Basabano permitted four consonant codas: /n s k l/, laying the groundwork for adding coda /s k/ to Jaobon (I must have realized at some point that coda /l/ can actually be quite difficult). Also, perhaps Basabano made me more open to admitting etymologies from outside the core three languages.

## Jaobon 2: the Return of Jaobon (2019)

In summer 2019, I came back onto the oligo scene with a new edition of Jaobon, which this time looks very much like the current version. It has 325 roots, which are only recorded in a [second Memrise course](https://community-courses.memrise.com/community/course/5526464/jaobon-2/1/). Without doing a real count, at a glance it looks like about 80% of the roots are still the same in current Jaobon, and the phonology looks much more like the current version, with the new coda consonants and 350 possible roots. I have no other materials in or about this version of Jaobon and don't even have any sentences written in it, but judging by the set of grammatical particles I'd say the intended grammar was more or less in line with the current version as well.

## Jaobon 3: In Code! (2023-)

In 2020 I started my career as a professional software engineer, and around that time every one of my hobbies became subsumed into being coding projects (seriously - [language learning](https://github.com/cstuartroe/membaca), [creative writing](https://github.com/cstuartroe/storyweb), music [performance](https://github.com/cstuartroe/notesy) and [composition](https://github.com/cstuartroe/scale-theory), [visual art](https://github.com/cstuartroe/svg_gen), [tabletop games](https://github.com/cstuartroe/celestial-cards), and of course [conlanging](https://github.com/cstuartroe/lauvinko), [conlanging](https://github.com/cstuartroe/kuna), [conlanging](https://github.com/cstuartroe/jaobon)). So naturally, when I picked Jaobon back up in April 2023 my first act was to [digitize it](https://github.com/cstuartroe/jaobon/commit/636da35dc303a9fa14424863a2de970288f6e4bc) and put it online.

Soon after, I [zipped up all the gaps](https://github.com/cstuartroe/jaobon/commit/e2d57ae5e92c52b7c70899adb314e8287c4b4d6c) and brought the language to 350 morphemes, occupying every permissible syllable.

In April 2024 I finally [wrote out](https://github.com/cstuartroe/jaobon/commit/a4ee704eaa1f50b2645a3403b413c243a2628f1) a reasonably comprehensive description of Jaobon grammar.

In January 2025 I [changed Jaobon phonology](https://github.com/cstuartroe/jaobon/commit/cd46ad4b49e74d2ff15d3c5a77aed8247e7b92d0) for the first time since 2019 and only the second time ever, adding the diphthong /oi̯/, bringing the total number of possible syllables to 366 and filling all the vacant real estate with new roots. This was partially motivated by wanting to [associate each calendar day](https://bsky.app/profile/jaobon.bsky.social) with a Jaobon root (I'm also into calendrics), and partially motivated by still feeling a bit cramped. Crazy as it may seem, that bump up from 350 to 366 roots felt like it was really hitting the sweet spot. I finally got to de-conflate terms for emotion and color, something which I'd found undesirable for a long time (previously, e.g. "blue" and "sad" were the same term), and added a few nice new roots that felt needed. For the first time in Jaobon's history, I really feel like every root has semantic breathing room and there are no gaps nor any ideas that are challenging to express. There's also been a steep reduction in seriously phonetically mangled etymologies. 

Now Jaobon has a dictionary exceeding 1000 entries and a corpus of translations exceeding 8000 roots, and is finally feeling like a mature, convincing, and presentable project. I think I accomplished the original goal of finding the number of roots that makes an oligoanalytic language "click" for me - where any fewer would feel cramped, but where I can't think of any root I'd like to add or split up. 

# Phonology

Like most languages in the [Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia_linguistic_area), Jaobon has a phonology heavily centered upon the syllable, with no clear level of phonological organization above the syllable. Also like most of those languages, the set of consonants appearing in the syllable onset is markedly different from the set appearing in the syllable coda. Unlike most of those languages, Jaobon does not employ contrastive syllable tone; indeed, Jaobon does not use any kind of lexically contrastive prosody.

Jaobon phonology is intended to be fairly easy and universally accessible, although in the interest of having enough monosyllabic roots it does have phonemic contrasts (such as a fortis-lenis distinction in stops) and phonotactic complexities (such as syllable-final consonants) that exceed the complexity of some natural languages. In general, an attempt was made to limit these to those which would be easy for the majority of speakers to use. For instance, the large majority of widely-spoken world languages make some type of vocal onset time distinction for stops, and where gaps exist there should be possible substitutions available (e.g., Arabic speakers may use [f] for /p/); the difficulty which, e.g., Tamil or Greek speakers may find with the distinction did not prevent its inclusion. Similarly, I made the judgement that a very constrained set of syllable-final consonants is in practice easy enough to learn even for speakers whose languages do not have them, though place of articulation contrasts were avoided there for the sake of ease. Some widely spoken languages are not entirely compatible with Jaobon phonology, e.g., even Spanish speakers may struggle with the distinction between /d͡ʒ/ and /j/. 

Jaobon has 17 initial consonants:

|  | **Labial** | **Alveolar<sup>1</sup>** | **Palatal** | **Velar** | **Glottal** |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Nasal** | m | n |  |  |  |
| **Fortis stop/affricate<sup>2</sup>** | p | t | t͡ʃ <sup>3</sup> | k | ʔ |
| **Lenis stop/affricate<sup>2</sup>** | b | d | d͡ʒ <sup>3</sup> | g |  |
| **Fricative<sup>4</sup>** |  | s | ʃ <sup>5</sup> |  | h <sup>6</sup> |
| **Approximant** | w | l <sup>7</sup> | j |  |  |

- <sup>1</sup> In free variation with dental place of articulation.
- <sup>2</sup> The fortis-lenis distinction may surface as a difference in voicing, aspiration, or both, or even in length or some other feature that may be interpreted as a fortis-lenis binary. I notate stops/affricates in broad transcription as though they contrast in voicing.
- <sup>3</sup> May be any coronal affricate: [t͡ʃ d͡ʒ], [t͡ɕ d͡ʑ], [t͡ʂ d͡ʐ], or even [t͡s d͡z].
- <sup>4</sup> Voicing is non-contrastive in fricatives, but they preferably remain unvoiced. This is because some listeners may have trouble distinguishing between voiced affricates and fricatives.
- <sup>5</sup> Free variation: [ʃ\~ɕ\~ʂ].
- <sup>6</sup> Free variation: [h\~x\~χ\~ʁ].
- <sup>7</sup> May be any lateral or rhotic consonant.

Jaobon has the common system of five cardinal vowels /a e i o u/. It also has three diphthongs /ai̯ au̯ oi̯/. The realization of the vowels is flexible as long as a five-way contrast is maintained, and /oi̯/ in particular permits variation such as [oi̯\~ui̯\~we\~wi\~ɥi\~ø\~y\~øy̯] etc.

A number of initial-vowel sequences are disallowed: /ti/, /di/, /si/, /hi/, /ji/, and /wu/. Because /oi̯/ may often be pronounced [we\~wi] or similar, it is not permitted to have the onset /w/; the root /oi̯/ is merely an interjection to avoid confusion with the roots /we/ and /wi/, and similarly the root /joi̯/ is a marginal interjection as some speakers may find it difficult to pronounce.

Jaobon has three possible coda consonant phonemes:

- A stop /Q/, which is typically pronounced [k̚] or [ʔ], but may optionally assimilate in place to a following consonant.
- A nasal /N/, which is typically [n\~ŋ\~ɴ] before a pause, but usually assimilates in place to a following consonant. May also surface as nasalization of the previous vowel.
- A fricative /S/, which is preferably [s] but may be any fricative sound.

Jaobon syllable structure is CV(C), with an initial consonant and a vowel required and a coda optional. A coda consonant may not occur after a diphthong. These phonotactics result in 366 permissible syllables. In Jaobon, all 366 possible syllables are morphemes with a specific meaning:

|  | **ʔ** | **m** | **n** | **p** | **t** | **t͡ʃ** | **k** | **b** | **d** | **d͡ʒ** | **g** | **s** | **ʃ** | **h** | **w** | **l** | **j** |

# Writing Systems

Jaobon has three canonical writing systems - Latin alphabet, CJK characters, and Featural Dots. The first two are described here; to see the Featural Dots font, view the [Jaobon website](https://jaobon.conorstuartroe.com/scripts).

## Latin alphabet

Jaobon uses a purely phonemic romanization scheme, that hopefully largely satisfies the principle of least surprise, although in an effort to keep every consonant spelling to one letter, I made the perhaps mildly spicy choices /t͡ʃ/ ⟨c⟩ and /ʃ/ ⟨x⟩ (take up any complaints with Indonesian and Portuguese, respectively). Its romanization for syllable-initial consonants is as follows: 

|  | **Labial** | **Alveolar** | **Palatal** | **Velar** | **Glottal** |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Nasal** | /m/ ⟨m⟩ | /n/ ⟨n⟩ |  |  |  |
| **Fortis stop/affricate** | /p/ ⟨p⟩ | /t/ ⟨t⟩ | /t͡ʃ/ ⟨c⟩ | /k/ ⟨k⟩ | /ʔ/ ⟨⟩<sup>1</sup> |
| **Lenis stop/affricate** | /b/ ⟨b⟩ | /d/ ⟨d⟩ | /d͡ʒ/ ⟨j⟩ | /g/ ⟨g⟩ |  |
| **Fricative** |  | /s/ ⟨s⟩ | /ʃ/ ⟨x⟩ |  | /h/ ⟨h⟩ |
| **Lenis stop/affricate** | /w/ ⟨w⟩ | /l/ ⟨l⟩ | /j/ ⟨y⟩ |  |  |

- <sup>1</sup> The glottal stop is not written in romanization.

The vowels /a e i o u/ are romanized ⟨a e i o u⟩, because I'm not a madman. /ai̯ au̯ oi̯/ are ⟨ai ao oi⟩ (with ⟨ao⟩ taking inspiration from Mandarin Pinyin), and the coda consonants /Q N S/ are spelled ⟨k n s⟩. 

## CJK Characters

Every one of Jaobon's 366 roots has an assigned CJK character spelling, which can be found in the [root list](/roots).

For roots taken from Mandarin and Japanese, I use the (simplified) character used to spell the source word/morpheme; for the handful of roots which derive from multiple Mandarin terms which happen to have similar sounds and meanings, I picked the character used for whichever, in my judgement, is closest to the core meaning of the Jaobon root. Roots derived from two-character Mandarin words generally take their initial consonant and their vowel from the first Mandarin syllable, and their final consonant from the initial consonant of the second Mandarin syllable; in such cases, I spell the Jaobon root with the first character of the Mandarin word, since it contributes the bulk of the phonetic information. 

For roots derived from languages not conventionally spelled with CJK characters, I simply chose a CJK character whose meaning matches the Jaobon root.

Of note: I strictly use simplified characters to spell Jaobon, as their greater graphical simplicity suits the fact that Jaobon uses many fewer characters than any other language using CJK characters. It would actually be non-trivial to convert Jaobon spelling to traditional equivalents, as many single characters used in Jaobon are the simplified variant of multiple traditional characters of different meanings, with the meaning of more than one traditional character serving as inspiration for the meaning of the root as used in Jaobon. 

## Representation of proper nouns

Proper nouns like personal names and place names are set apart orthographically in all writing systems for Jaobon. In the Latin alphabet, names are written capitalized, with all syllables grouped together without spaces: *Toma*. In CJK characters double angle brackets are placed around the name: 《头妈》. 

# Syntax

This section attempts to describe Jaobon syntax in maximum detail and precision. For someone aspiring to learn Jaobon, it may not be necessary to read this section, at least not in its entirety. Jaobon syntax is quite similar to that of its major source languages of Mandarin, English, and Spanish, and is probably possible to acquire implicitly via exposure. 

## Parts of speech

Every Jaobon root has an explicitly assigned part of speech. Maximally, there are 20 distinct parts of speech, although some could be considered classes of bound morphemes rather than word classes, and also some parts of speech are probably subtypes of others, with the syntactic tests to distinguish between parts of speech often being fairly weak. In particular, there tends to be great flexibility for most roots to function as both nouns and noun modifiers. 

Nominals:

- [noun: 128 roots](/roots?pos=noun)
- [positional: 12 roots](/roots?pos=positional)
- [numeral: 14 roots](/roots?pos=numeral)
- [pronoun: 4 roots](/roots?pos=pronoun)
- [determiner: 3 roots](/roots?pos=determiner)
- [nominalizer: 1 roots](/roots?pos=nominalizer)

Intransitives:

- [intransitive verb: 44 roots](/roots?pos=intransitive verb)
- [adjective: 59 roots](/roots?pos=adjective)
- [number particle: 1 roots](/roots?pos=number particle)

Transitives:

- [transitive verb: 74 roots](/roots?pos=transitive verb)
- [preposition: 6 roots](/roots?pos=preposition)
- [existential: 1 roots](/roots?pos=existential)

Other:

- [adverb: 20 roots](/roots?pos=adverb)
- [aspect particle: 7 roots](/roots?pos=aspect particle)
- [voice particle: 2 roots](/roots?pos=voice particle)
- [coordinating conjunction: 2 roots](/roots?pos=coordinating conjunction)
- [subordinating conjunction: 1 roots](/roots?pos=subordinating conjunction)
- [relativizer: 1 roots](/roots?pos=relativizer)
- [linking particle: 2 roots](/roots?pos=linking particle)
- [interjection: 4 roots](/roots?pos=interjection)

## Sentence order

Jaobon is analytical and has a strict word order. The word order of a clause is (with optional elements in brackets): 

[subordinating conjunction] [topic] subject [aspect particles] [adverbs] predicates [oblique phrases] 

### Subject

The subject is any noun phrase. 

### Aspect particles

Aspect particles are prepositions and verbs which Jaobon co-opts for aspectual (sometimes mixed with tense) meaning. 过 *pas* "across, over" indicates an experiential/retrospective aspect and/or past tense. 向 *a* "to" indicates a prospective aspect or future tense. 在 *en* "in, on" indicates a progressive aspect, which may have a default present-tense interpretation, but can certainly be used for past and future times if context makes that clear: 时者我在工，他过言向我 *xas ki mi en wok, ta pas des a mi* "When I was working, she spoke to me." 站 *pa* "stop" indicates a cessative aspect: 你站速走 *ni pa su wak* "you stop running." 坐 *sen* "sit" indicates a continuative aspect: 你坐速走 *ni sen su wak* "you continue running." 开 *kai* "open" indicates an inchoative/inceptive aspect: 你开速走 *ni kai su wak* "you start to run." 变 *ben* "change" also indicates an inceptive aspect, but is preferred for adjectives or states, while 开 *kai* is preferred for verbs, or predicates conveying more dynamic action: 他变红 *ta ben hon* "it turns red." 开 *kai* vs. 变 *ben* may be used for the same predicate, to lend a sense of action vs. state change respectively: 油开流 *yos kai lu* "the oil begins flowing (as though poured etc.)" vs. 油变流 *yos ben lu* "the fat melts." 

A clause with no aspect particles may be interpreted as a simple present, a past or future perfective, or a gnomic, depending on context. 

Aspect particles can be chained according to logical order: 你向站速走 *ni a pa su wak* "you will stop running." 我过开使学 *mi pas kai as xes* "I have started studying." 

### Adverbs

Jaobon's 20 adverbs appear in between aspect particles and predicates: 我过该工 *mi pas gai wok* "I should have worked." Like aspect particles, they can be chained according to logical order: 我过该更工 *mi pas gai mas wok* "I should have worked more." 

### Predicates

A predicate consists of an optional voice particle, a required predicate core, and an optional direct object. A predicate core may be a noun phrase, an intransitive phrase (intransitive verb, adjective, number particle), or a transitive phrase (transitive verb, preposition, existential). A direct object is not permitted if the predicate core is a noun phrase. A direct object generally is required if the predicate core is a transitive phrase (though it can be dropped for some transitive roots), unless it uses the voice particle 是 *es*, which forms a passive. A direct object is not permitted for intransitive predicate cores unless they use the voice particle 使 *as*. Intransitive and transitive phrases are generally a single root, though modifiers may come before the root acting as the head of the phrase in lexicalized combinations. 

There are two voice particles, 使 *as* and 是 *es* The meaning of voice particles depends on the type of predicate core: 

- For most noun phrases, only 是 *es* may be used. It essentially functions as a copula, equating the subject and verbal phrase: 头刺兽是奶兽 *to pin an es lak an* "Deers are mammals." Although it is the only possible voice particle, it is still most common to include the particle to clearly separate the subject from the predicate, since nouns may often directly modify other nouns. It is most likely to be dropped in simple sentences: 他学人 *ta xes jen* "he is a student."<br/>A special case of noun phrases, complementizer phrases, can use the voice particle 使 *as* with a causative meaning: 我过使何他吃水 *mi pas as ke ta co wa* "I made him drink water."<br/>
- Intransitive predicate cores may use 是 *es* or no voice particle with the same meaning - that the predicate describes the subject: 他是高 *ta es gao* or 他高 *ta gao* "he is tall." The choice of whether or not to use 是 *es* is basically the same as for noun predicate cores - including 是 *es* can resolve syntactic ambiguity or otherwise make the structure of the clause more obvious.<br/>Intransitive predicate cores can use 使 *as*, which permits the presence of a direct object. If there is a direct object, the clause takes on a causative meaning: 我使健他 *mi as he ta* "I make him healthy," or "I heal him." Without a direct object, it has a volitional or reflexive meaning: 我使健 *mi as he* "I am intentionally healthy," or "I make myself healthy."<br/>
- Transitive predicates, in contrast, default to the same meaning as 使 *as* if a voice particle is not included. With 使 *as* or no voice particle, the subject is the agent, with a generally required direct object being the patient: 我使吃水 *mi as co wa* or 我吃水 *mi co wa* "I drink water." Unlike with the use of 是 *es* for nouns and intransitives, including the voice particle is not just a matter of clarifying the syntax of the sentence, but may also suggest greater volition: 我过损玩 *mi pas pe hu* "I lost the game" vs. 我过使损玩 *mi pas as pe hu* "I (intentionally) lost the game."<br/>Transitive predicates may use 是 *es*, which indicates a passive meaning and forbids a direct object: 我在是追 *mi en es ces* "I am being followed." The agent can be recovered with the preposition 于 *nis*: 我在是追于他 *mi en es ces nis ta* "I'm being followed by him."<br/>Note the perhaps surprising syntax that this implies for prepositions, which are a subtype of transitives: to mean "it is under the table," 他是在桌下 *ta es en jos bon* is incorrect, although it might be an apparent word-for-word translation from English or Spanish. 他 *ta* has an agent role with regard to the transitive 在 *en*, so it must use either 使 *as* or no voice particle. No voice particle is prototypical for prepositions: 他在桌下 *ta en jos bon*. 使 *as* may be used to imply volition: 他使在桌下 *ta as en jos bon* would be correct if, for instance, "it" was an animal that had gone under the table. This is a normal way to express willful motion: 他使向买所 *ta as a mai luk* "she's going to the store".<br/>

A major exception to the general rules for subjects and predicates is the existential 有 *yo*, which I class as a special transitive part of speech. It behaves like a transitive verb with the meaning "have": 我有们书 *mi yo men buk* "I have many books," and 这约有吃所 *je yak yo co luk* "there's a restaurant near here." However, there are two major differences from other transitives: 

- 有 *yo* cannot use voice particles.
- Instead of a normal passive construction, 有 *yo* can be used in an existential construction that simply lacks a subject: 有人者能助你 *yo jen ki ken yuk ni* "there's someone who can help you." This is one of two clause types in Jaobon which may lack a subject, the other being imperatives. This 有 *yo*...者 *ki* pattern in particular is used like an indefinite article, to introduce a subject which has not previously been mentioned: 有人者过使站在路 *yo jen ki pas as pa en pu* "a person was standing in the street." 

There may be multiple predicates within a single clause. Optionally, they can be separated by a coordinating conjunction, but more typically they simply occur back-to-back: 我坐又吃饭 *mi sen i co pan* or 我坐吃饭 *mi sen co pan* "I sit and eat." A direct object can be shared between two or more predicates, appearing only in the last one: 他把吃茶 *ta ba co cai* "she grabbed the tea and drank it." Voice particles apply to subsequent predicates until a new voice particle is included: 走蜥过使吃又末切虫 *wak xis pas as co i mo cek con* "the lizard ate the insect, which killed the insect", but 走蜥过使吃切虫又是末 *wak xis pas as co cek con i es mo* "the lizard ate the insect, and the lizard died." 

### Subordinating conjunction

The subordinating conjunctions are 如 *juk* "if" and 为者 *we ki* "in order to." They appear at the beginning of a clause and make the clause subordinate; it may come before or after the corresponding main clause. 

### Oblique phrases

Oblique phrases in Jaobon are isolated noun phrases which have some oblique meaning. The most common roots to serve as head of an oblique phrase by far are 时 *xas* "time," 为 *we* "way, manner," and 次 *bes* "instance." 

为 *we* is used to form adverbs of manner: 我使言速为 *mi as des su we* "I speak quickly." This includes 何为 *ke we* "how." 

时 *xas* is the head root of many lexicalized combinations referring to units or periods of time: 日时 *son xas* "day," 切时 *cek xas* "minute," 早时 *sao xas* "morning." Some lexicalized terms for time have other head roots: 年 *nen* "year," 午中 *nun mes* "noon," 时点 *xas gok* "second." Units of time can be prefixed with 这 *je* "this" to refer to the current one: 这日时 *je son xas*, and 前 *cen* "in front" and 后 *bek* "behind" for the previous and next: 前星时 *cen xin xas* "last week," 后日时 *bek son xas* "tomorrow." Two periods before or after can be expressed by doubling 前 *cen* or 后 *bek*, while two or more periods away can be expressed by inserting a number in between 前 *cen* or 后 *bek* and the time word: 前前日时 *cen cen son xas* or 前二日时 *cen dos son xas* "the day before yesterday, two days ago." Time words can also be prefixed with 何 *ke* "what, which" to form an interrogative: 何年 *ke nen* "which year." Note also simply 何时 *ke xas* "when." Time words ending in 时 *xas* may have the 时 *xas* dropped when they are prefixed: 这日 *je son* "today" instead of 这日时 *je son xas*. 

时 *xas* is also used as the head of oblique phrases in another way: in the set phrase 时者 *xas ki* "when, the time that." For example: 时者我摸他，他热。 *xas ki mi tok ta, ta hok.* "when I touched it, it was hot." This is structurally just a relative clause modifying 时 *xas*. 

Another common oblique phrase head is 次 *bes* "instance, time": 三次我言 *san bes mi des* "I spoke three times." Note the phrases 们次 *men bes*, which means not just "many times," but also "often," and 更次 *mas bes*, meaning "usually," and 新次 *nu bes* "again." 

Note that clause-level prepositional phrases are not classed as oblique phrases, but as predicates, and may come before or after other predicates: 他使坐在活房 *ta as sen en bi kas* or 他使在活房坐 *ta as en bi kas sen* "she sits in the house." 

### Topics

A single prepositional or oblique phrase may come at the beginning of a clause, functioning as a topic: 这时前我觉何你更高从我 *je xas cen mi jek ke ni mas gao de mi* "before now I thought you were taller than me", 在房内家人坐晚吃 *en kas den ja jen sen wan co* "inside the house, the family is eating dinner". 

Ability to topicalize in this way is the only robust syntactic test to distinguish prepositions from verbs in Jaobon. 

### Recipients and benefactors

Jaobon does not have indirect objects as a syntactic position. Recipients are the direct object of the verb 给 *ge* "give," with the thing being given being the object of a verb like 把 *ba* "hold" in a separate predicate: 他过把礼物给我 *ta pas ba li kos ge mi* "she gave me a gift." Benefactors are similarly direct objects of the verb 助 *yuk* "help": 我过助你带他来 *mi pas yuk ni dai ta lai* "I brought it for you." 

Such sentences are not really possible to passivize in the normal way, though this is true for any sentence with multiple predicates which are hard to conceptually separate. Making a recipient a subject can simply be accomplished with the verb 收 *gek* "receive" (我过收礼物从他 *mi pas gek li kos de ta* "I got a gift from her"), though this is kind of cheating. The only other possibility is clefting with relative clauses: 礼物是者他把给我 *li kos es ki ta ba ge mi* "a gift is what she gave me." 

## Noun phrase order

Noun phrases have a single head root, with modifiers branching in both directions from the noun. 

### Left-branching modifiers

Modifiers before the head of the noun phrase are directly attached. Determiners and numerals come before the head, in that order: 这三人 *je san jen* "these three people." Noun lexemes in Jaobon are also typically built in a left-branching fashion: 学人 *xes jen* "student" - the head is 人 *jen* "person," not 学 *xes* "study." Adjectives may come before the head of the noun phrase, although this is preferred only for lexicalized or at least commonly-repeated combinations: 公土 *gon tu* "park, public land." 

Modifiers coming before the head of a noun phrase are very flexible, in that nearly any part of speech can appear in that position. Note noun-noun compounds like 眼玻 *yek las* "eyeglasses," verb-noun compounds like 引肉 *in nik* "muscle," and even entire predicates behaving as a modifier like in 言规人 *des ges jen* "lawyer." As a result, they don't obey a fixed set of rules for the relationship between modifier and head, tending to obey conventions specific to the head or type of construction. For example, prefixing 人 *jen* "person" with a bare transitive verb tends to form an agent noun, not a patient noun: 信人 *cos jen* refers to someone who puts trust in someone else, not to the trustee or confidant. But prefixing 物 *kos* "thing, object" with a transitive verb can refer to an instrument or a patient, and the meaning is simply lexicalized: compare 写物 *xe kos* "pen" with 吃物 *co kos* "food." 

### Genitives and linking particles

Jaobon has a linking genitive particle 从 *de* which can be used similarly to Spanish *de* to mark possession or any other relationship between two nouns. For example, 书从他 *buk de ta* can mean "his book" as in "the book he owns" or "the book he wrote." 

Genitives can also be expressed as with the possessor as a left-branching modifier, filling the same syntactic slot as a determiner (e.g., 他书 *ta buk* "his book"). 

There is no rigid criteria for which strategy to use, although the genitive particle 从 *de* is generally preferred for possessors consisting of more than one root. 

There is one other linking particle which allows one noun to modify another: 于 *nis* "about". It is used for conceptual relationships between noun phrases: 言于导机 *des nis gi jik* "discussion about politics", 书于兽 *buk nis an* "book about animals". 

Although 从 *de* and 于 *nis* are both prepositions, other prepositions cannot be used to directly link nouns: *桌在烧所 *jos en kuk luk*. The relativizer 者 *ki* must be used: 桌者在烧所 *jos ki en kuk luk* "table in the kitchen". This is because most other prepositions double as aspect particles, which could lead to ambiguity if allowed to join noun phrases as well. 

### Relative clauses

Branching rightward also happens via relative clauses, marked with the relativizer particle 者 *ki*. Relative clauses occur more frequently in Jaobon than in English or Spanish, but less often than Mandarin noun modifiers in 的. Jaobon relative clauses may have other nominal arguments, and the head noun may be a subject, direct object, or oblique role in the relative clause. An example of a relative clause where the head noun is a subject: 人者不吃肉 *jen ki no co nik* "person who does not eat meat." An example of a relative clause where the head noun is a direct object: 物者我过看 *kos ki mi pas kan* "thing I saw." Examples of relative clauses where the head noun is an oblique argument: 为者我们过作他 *we ki mi men pas mak ta* "how we made it," 时者我们作他 *xas ki mi men mak ta* "the time when we made it." 

Jaobon uses a gapping strategy for relative clauses, with no relative or resumptive pronouns. If the predicate contains no subject, then the head noun is taken to be the subject: 人者备 *jen ki lis* "clever person." If the predicate does contain a subject and permits an object, then the head noun is assumed to be the object, unless semantics make it obvious that the head noun is oblique: 物者我吃 *kos ki mi co* "the thing I eat" (head noun is object), but 为者我吃 *we ki mi co* "the manner in which I eat." If both subject and object slots are filled in the relative clause, the head noun must be oblique. 

Relative clauses are used not just for complex modifying clauses in Jaobon, but are the preferred strategy for adjectives unless the adjectival meaning is a core part of the noun phrase, most often because it is an at least somewhat lexicalized phrase. That is, 车者红 *ce ki hon* would be the normal way to say "red car", not 红车 *hon ce*. 

Note the perhaps unintuitive syntax for relative clauses where the shared noun is the object of a preposition: 所者你在 *luk ki ni en* "the place where you are." This follows from the syntax for relative clauses with transitive predicates in general. 

A relative clause can also be a noun phrase in itself, with no head noun: 者我找 *ki mi bus* "what I found." 

### Noun phrase heads

A noun phrase may be headed by any nominal root. Nouns, numerals, positionals, demonstratives, and pronouns are unambiguously nominal and can easily be a complete noun phrase on their own. Pronouns, in fact, cannot take modifiers. On the other hand, the nominalizer 性 *nes* must have left-branching modifiers: 大性 *bik nes* "size." 

Any intransitive may also be the head of a noun phrase. Adjectives and intransitive verbs can stand on their own as the head of a noun phrase, but like the nominalizer 性 *nes*, the number suffix 们 *men* must have left-branching modifiers: 人们 *jen men* "people". The actual meaning of adjectives and intransitive verbs when they behave as nouns varies, with the tendency being for adjectives to refer to some entity described by the adjective, and intransitive verbs to refer to the concept of the verb or a single instance, but this is flexible and may be up to interpretation depending on context. 我喜美 *mi xi be* could mean "I like the beautiful (thing)," "I like beautiful things," or "I like beauty," depending on context. Similarly, 我身于客 *mi koi nis bis* is somewhat ambiguous in its meaning, most likely meaning "I am afraid of travel," but perhaps meaning "I am afraid of travelers/guests." Ambiguity can always be easily resolved by simply adding the nominalizer 性 *nes* on the end to form an abstract noun (e.g., 美性 *be nes* "beauty," 客性 *bis nes* "traveling, tourism") or a noun root like 人 *jen* "person" or 物 *kos* "thing" to form a concrete noun (e.g., 美物 *be kos* "beautiful thing," 客人 *bis jen* "traveler, guest".) Some intransitive roots have conventional meanings that may be their default interpretation as a noun, e.g., 茶 *cai* means "boil" as a predicate, but "tea" as a noun. 

Transitives verbs may also be the head of a noun phrase, in a manner similar to intransitive verbs. There are some few transitive verbs which have conventionalized meanings as a noun, e.g., 刺 *pin* means "pierce" as a verb, and "pin" or "thorn" as a noun. Other transitive roots - that is, prepositions and the existential 有 *yo* - cannot be the head of a noun phrase. 

### Positionals

Positionals are a class of words unknown to European languages, but common in languages of other regions, including being ubiquitous in Mandarin. They basically refer to some location relative to a noun, carrying much of the semantic information that would be carried by prepositions in English, so that fewer prepositional distinctions can be made: 在房内 *en kas den* "in the house" vs. 在房下 *en kas bon* "under the house". 

As seen in the previous example sentences, positionals simply come after the nominal that they denote a position relative to, with that nominal syntactically being a left-branching modifier of the positional. 

The nominal can also come after the positional linked by 从 *de*, which can be clearer when dealing with complex nominals: 在下从房者绿 *en bon de kas ki gin* "under the green house". 

### Number

Jaobon has an optional plural suffix 们 *men* which can be used for any noun: 人们 *jen men* "people", 吃所们 *co luk men* "restaurants". Syntactically, 们 *men* is behaving as the head of the noun phrase, with the pluralized noun being a left-branching modifier. Note that 们 *men* as a modifier, rather than a head, means "many". 

Nouns without the plural suffix should not be taken to be necessarily plural, but rather of indeterminate number. A bare noun may refer to multiple referents if other cues make that clear: 更次犬有后条 *mas bes dok yo bek cao* "dogs usually have tails". 

A special case of this is nouns modified by a numeral, which should never also have a plural suffix: 三犬 *san dok* "three dogs", not *三犬们 *san dok men*. 

## Non-indicative sentences

### Interrogatives

Jaobon has some preference for wh-fronting. If there is an interrogative oblique like 何为 *ke we* "how" or 何时 *ke xas* "when," it appears in the pre-subject position. If an interrogative argument, like 何 *ke* "what," 何人 *ke jen* "who", or 何计（物） *ke ji (kos)* "how many (things)," would be the object, there is a preference to shift it to being the subject via a passive (e.g., 何是吃于你？ *ke es co nis ni?* "what did you eat?") or a free relative clause (e.g., 何是者你吃？ *ke es ki ni co?* "what did you eat?"). This is not mandatory, though: 你吃何？ *ni co ke?* may be a less usual, though perhaps more informal, way to ask "what did you eat?" 

For polar questions, a sentence-final particle 另 *o* is used: 你喜他另？ *ni xi ta o?* "do you like it?" 另 *o* is also a conjunction meaning "or"; the implication of utterance-final 另 *o* is an implicit negative clause, i.e. 你喜他另不喜他？ *ni xi ta o no xi ta?* "do you like it or not"? 

### Imperatives and hortatives

Jaobon imperatives lack an overt subject: 找他！ *bus ta!* "find it!" Imperative clauses also cannot have a subordinating conjunction or aspect particles, so that the predicate is often the first element of the sentence. However, the adverb 不 *no* "not" is very normal in imperatives: 不找他！ *no bus ta!* "don't search for it!" and the adverbs 更 *mas* "more," 也 *ye* "also," and 就 *jo* (normally meaning "as soon as", but in imperatives expressing urgency) are also permitted. 

Imperatives never use the voice particle 使 *as*, but still use 是 *es* as expected. That is, *使找他！ *as bus ta!* "find it!" and *使备！ *as lis!* "get ready!" are not grammatical, with simply 找他！ *bus ta!* and 备！ *lis!* being correct, but 是争人！ *es puk jen!* "be a soldier!" and 是看！ *es kan!* "be seen!" are grammatical. 

The tone of an imperative can be softened with a predicate 来 *lai* "come" or 请 *cin* "politely request" before the main predicate: 来找他！ *lai bus ta!* or 请找他！ *cin bus ta!* "please find it!" 

Hortatives that include the speaker actually do have a subject 我们 *mi men* "we" and mandatorily include 来 *lai*: 我们来找他！ *mi men lai bus ta!* "let's find it!" Note that such sentences can be read as plain indicative sentences as well - only context and tone of voice clarifies which mood is intended. 

## Other topics

### Comparatives

A comparative phrase in Jaobon uses the adverb 更 *mas* before the quality or action being compared, with the object of comparison in a later predicate with the preposition 从 *de*: 你更高从他 *ni mas gao de ta* "you're taller than him." 

Comparatives with properties with verbal meanings compare frequency or intensity: 我更读书从你 *mi mas les buk de ni* "I read more books than you" or "I read books more often than you." 

Superlatives can be the same as comparatives, or optionally clarified with 从每 *de me* "than everything/everyone": 你更高从每 *ni mas gao de me* "you're the tallest." 

### Comparative correlatives

Phrases communicated in English with "the more... the more..." and Mandarin with "越... 越..." are translated in Jaobon with an oblique clause 次者。。。更。。。 *bes ki... mas...* in a main clause with the adverbs 就更 *jo mas*: 次者更们，就更好 *bes ki mas men, jo mas hao* "the more, the better." 

The similar phrase structure in English "more and more..." and in Mandarin "越来越..." has a completely different 过时就更 *pas xas jo mas* equivalent in Jaobon: 这小人过时就更高 *je xao jen pas xas jo mas gao* "that child is getting taller and taller." 

### As ... as possible

This adverbial concept is expressed in Lauvinko with an oblique phrase 更。。。为者能 *mas ... we ki ken*: 请作这更速为者能 *cin mak je mas su we ki ken* "please do it ASAP." 

### Preposition support

Prepositions can be awkward to use directly with aspect particles, since they are often homonymous. For instance, 我过向飞流土 *mi pas a bo lu tu* "I went to the airport" is a little odd, with two prepositions in a row (过向 *pas a*). 我向向飞流土 *mi a a bo lu tu* "I will go to the airport" is even stranger, with two 向 *a* in a row. These sentences are grammatical, but it is more natural to use a supporting intransitive. With prepositions of motion (向 *a*, 怒 *has*, 过 *pas*), this is normally 走 *wak*: 我过走向飞流土 *mi pas wak a bo lu tu*. 走 *wak* prototypically refers to walking on foot when in reference to people, but this connotation is weak, and discarded when implausible; The compound 脚走 *jao wak* specifically refers to walking on foot, and can be used to clarify: 我过脚走向飞流土 *mi pas jao wak a bo lu tu* "I walked to the airport". With 在 *en* and 于 *nis*, the normal supporting intransitive is 坐 *sen*: 我过坐在他房 *mi pas sen en ta kas* "I was in his house". Analogously, 坐 *sen* prototypically refers to a sitting position with human referents, but this is also a weak connotation. The compound 脚坐 *jao sen* analogously refers specifically to actually sitting. 

### Personal names and titles

Since any phonologically valid rendering of a name in Jaobon will sound like a sequence of existing roots, there is some risk of ambiguity between a name and the normal compositional meaning of those roots. A particularly difficult example is that someone named Jen may find their name to be very confusing in Jaobon, as it simply sounds like 人 *jen* "person". It is fair game to choose between any of one's names to predominantly use in Jaobon, if one fits Jaobon phonology better or is less confusable for a normal phrase. Phonetic distortions are also fine in order to arrive at a sequence of roots with a nicer meaning, e.g. the most straightforward phonetic rendering of my name (Conor) is probably 《口泳》 *Kona* or 《跌泳》 *Kana*, but I prefer 《识露》 *Konnak*. Taken a step further, there's nothing wrong with inventing an a priori Jaobon name for oneself. 

To reduce auditory ambiguity as well as convey social information, personal names are typically prefixed by a root acting like a title or the Mandarin name prefixes 老 and 小. The set of titles is fairly open, although using overly unconventional titles in speech may not serve to reduce confusion. 

The most neutral title possible is 他 *ta*, which conveys no information whatsoever about its referent, although it is so impersonal that it may only be appropriate if the identity of the referent is unknown or general, such as on a form or legal document. 

Another fairly neutral option is a title that only conveys gender information: 男 *nan*, 女 *nus*, or 放 *muk*, equivalent to English Mr., Ms., Mx. This is appropriate for fairly formal settings or unfamiliar people. 

Age/seniority based titles 故 *gu* and 小 *xao*, equivalent to Mandarin 老 and 小, convey a bit more social information but are probably only socially appropriate among somewhat closer associates. 

Less formal but still common titles include 友 *mik* or 美 *be* for friends and kinship terms like 子 *cik*, 兄 *kek*, 亲 *ma* (which need not be for actual blood relatives) 

The least formal and even humorous titles include physical attributes like 高 *gao*, 矮 *lo*, animals like 鼠 *mus*, 猴 *hus*, 鸟 *pak*, 熊 *os*, or any descriptor that feels appropriate, like 锐 *kin*, 奥 *ao*. 

These prefixed titles are distinguished from true occupational titles, e.g., 者使健 *ki as he* "medical doctor", which should come after the personal name. Such occupational titles may obviate the need for a name prefix: 《向礼》者使健 *Ali ki as he* or 故《向礼》者使健 *gu Ali ki as he* "Dr. Ali". 

### Names of countries and languages

Countries, languages, ethnic groups and the like are named with proper nouns much like personal names, with a single proper noun referring to the language, nation, etc., and being used as a modifier to terms like 国土 *nas tu* "country" or 言为 *des we* "language" to specify category. For example, 《悲车》 *Doice* means "German/Germany", and on its own can refer to the country, the ethnicity, or the language, but would more commonly modify another term. 

The term 国 *nas* refers to a nation in all senses - a place, a polity, a group of people sharing a national identity - and is the most common term to use for countries generically: 《悲车》国 *Doice nas* "Germany", 《中土》国 *Mestu nas* "China", etc. To more explicitly refer to only one of these sentence, 土 *tu* or 国土 *nas tu* may refer to the location, 机 *jik*, 土机 *tu jik*, or 国导机 *nas gi jik* to refer to the state or government, and 组 *guk* to refer to an ethnic group or national populace. 

Subnational divisions (provinces/states) use the term 块 *pis* or 国土块 *nas tu pis*: 《新右》块 *Nuyok pis* "New York state". Even smaller divisions (counties, townships, etc.) should use 所 *luk*: 《口者》所 *Koki luk* "County Cork". Cities and towns use 市 *dus*: 《新右》市 *Nuyok dus* "New York City". 土 *tu* also refers to continents: 《向计》土 *Aji tu*. 

人 *jen* can refer to a person with a particular ethnic or national identity: 《悲车》人 *Doice jen* "German person", with 机人 *jik jen* referring specifically to a legal citizen. 

言为 *des we* means "language" and is used to form a term for a specific language: 《悲车》言为 *Doice des we* "German language". 

Geographical terms like cardinal directions and "new" may be translated rather than phonetically rendered: 右《跌矮来泳》块 *yok Kalolaina pis* "North Carolina", 左《向每礼跌》土 *is Amelika tu* "South America".
