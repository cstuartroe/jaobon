        <h1>Basic semantic sets</h1>

        <p>
          I just wanted to list a few sets of roots here and discuss why certain concepts were included or left out.
          Some of these (positionals, numerals) correspond to entire parts of speech, others not.
        </p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>

        <p>
          Jaobon has six basic color terms:
        </p>

        {this.rootList(["dak", "wai", "hon", "lan", "kun", "gin"])}

        <p>
          It's not a particularly interesting set of color terms; six is the modal number of basic color terms{' '}
          <a href="https://wals.info/feature/133A#2/32.5/151.9" target="_blank">according to WALS</a>, and this
          is the canonical set if you're going to have six terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like the six-color model because it forms three pairs of optical opposites. This is the same logic
          by which I decided to give the{' '}
          <a href="http://celestial-cards.conorstuartroe.com/calendar/explanation" target="blank">Celestial Calendar</a>
          {' '}a six-color logic, and Jaobon has{' '}
          <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jaobon.bsky.social" target="_blank">some connection to that calendar</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Animals</h2>

        <p>
          Jaobon has {animalsInOrder.length} roots referring to animals, including {this.text('an')},
          which can refer to any animal but might have a default mammalian connotation. A few roots refer to broad
          groupings of non-mammals, while a large number refer to specific mammals.
        </p>

        {this.rootList(animalsInOrder)}

        <p>
          {this.text('con')} has quite a broad semantic range, seemingly including any protostome except some or all
          aquatic molluscs. I've given some cephalopods names with {this.text('yu')} as the head noun. I'm not really
          sure how I'd name bivalves; maybe they're weird enough to just get a term based on {this.text('an')}.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from cephalopods, {this.text('yu')} prototypically refers to fish (that is, the paraphyletic
          grouping of organisms which are members of Vertebrata but not Tetrapoda).
        </p>

        <p>
          {this.text('xis')} includes, in turn, all organisms which are members of Tetrapoda but not Synapsida or
          Aves; that is, all amphibians and non-bird reptiles.
        </p>

        <p>
          {this.text('pak')} can include most or all birds. {this.text('poi')} refers to fowl (which is *probably*
          a cladistic grouping, but is at least a well-defined grouping), and I'd probably consider it to be a hyponym
          of {this.text('pak')}. That is, any {this.text('poi')} is a {this.text('pak')} IMO.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another way to consider the meaning of {this.text('poi')} is to regard it not as a biological grouping,
          but a functional one, referring to domesticated birds, and maybe their close wild relatives (a category with
          considerable overlap with a biological category of fowl). This aligns with the fact that most of the roots
          referring to specific mammals refer to domesticated mammals: {this.text('dok')}, {this.text('gak')},{' '}
          {this.text('bak')}, {this.text('pok')}, {this.text('yan')}, {this.text('hos')}. In general, humans
          tend to talk more about domesticated animals than wild animals, and I think this semantic allocation
          approximately matches the vibes of natural languages. The roots referring to mostly non-domestic mammals
          are {this.text('mus')}, {this.text('os')}, {this.text('hus')}.
        </p>

        <p>
          {this.text('pak')} and {this.text('yu')} can simply refer to large groups of animals on their own.
          Most other large clades of animals need their own terms, to cope with the vagueness
          of {this.text('an')}, {this.text('xis')}, and {this.text('con')}: {this.text('lak an')} "mammal",
          {' '}{this.text('sek gos xis')} "reptile", {this.text('wa gos xis')} "amphibian",{' '}
          {this.text('cek con')} "arthropod", {this.text('ses jao con')} "insect".
        </p>

        <p>
          I think the most psychologically or culturally significant animal snubbed for its own root was the snake.
          I imagine it was mostly left out merely because most of its good candidates for roots needed to be used
          for higher-priority meanings: {this.text('xe')} from Mandarin è›‡, {this.text('sek')} from Spanish{' '}
          <i>serpiente</i>, etc. Luckily it's pretty conceptually easy to express the idea of a snake: {this.text('cao xis')}.
        </p>

        <h2>Positionals</h2>

        <p>
          Jaobon has {positionalsInOrder.length} positionals:
        </p>

        {this.rootList(positionalsInOrder)}

        <p>
          Some of these are clearly in pairs of opposites: {this.text('cen')} vs. {this.text('bek')},
          {' '}{this.text('xan')} vs. {this.text('bon')}, {this.text('is')} vs. {this.text('yok')}.
          The rest could be laid along a spectrum of proximity: {this.text('mes')} and {this.text('den')},
          {' '}then {this.text('pi')} and {this.text('la')}, then {this.text('yak')}, then {this.text('ek')}.
        </p>

        <p>
          An argument could be made that I *could* have gotten away without a {this.text('mes')} vs. {this.text('den')}
          {' '}distinction and a {this.text('pi')} vs. {this.text('la')} distinction, but I see pretty clear
          distinctions in usage. {this.text('den')} refers to somewhere in the interior of a space, or the entire
          interior, and prototypically refers to three-dimensional space, while {this.text('mes')} is the exact
          center and prototypically refers to one-dimensional spectra. {this.text('pi')} is simply a surface or edge,
          while {this.text('la')} is the lateral sides of something as opposed to the front or back, and not necessarily
          the actual surface but perhaps the immediately adjacent space. Maybe, one might argue, {this.text('la')} and{' '}
          {this.text('yak')} should be the same root, but I still like the distinction between lateral adjacency vs.
          nearness in any direction.
        </p>

        <h2>Numerals</h2>

        <p>
          Jaobon has {numeralsInOrder.length} numeric roots:
        </p>

        {this.rootList(numeralsInOrder)}

        <p>
          Not much to say. It's base ten and has powers of ten up to 10<sup>3</sup>. Beyond that, further powers of ten need
          to be expressed compositionally: {this.text('das tao')} 10<sup>4</sup>, {this.text('bai tao')} 10<sup>5</sup>,
          {' '}{this.text('tao tao')} 10<sup>6</sup>, {this.text('tao mon se san bes')} 10<sup>9</sup>.
        </p>
      </>
    );
  }
}
